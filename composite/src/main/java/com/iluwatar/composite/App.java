/**
 * The Composite pattern is a partitioning design pattern. The Composite pattern describes that a
 * group of objects is to be treated in the same way as a single instance of an object. The intent
 * of a composite is to "compose" objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies.
 * Implementing the Composite pattern lets clients treat individual objects and compositions
 * uniformly.
 * 组合模式是一种分区设计模式。Composite模式描述了将一组对象作为对象的单个实例进行处理的方式。组合的目的是将对象“组合”成树结构，以表示部分-整体层次结构。
 * 实现Composite模式让客户端能够统一对待单个对象和组合。
 *
 * <p>In this example we have sentences composed of words composed of letters. All of the objects
 * can be treated through the same interface ({@link LetterComposite}).
 * 在这个例子中，我们有由字母组成的单词组成的句子。所有的对象都可以通过相同的接口来处理({@link LetterComposite})。
