/**
 * The Decorator pattern is a more flexible alternative to subclassing. The Decorator class
 * implements the same interface as the target and uses composition to "decorate" calls to the
 * target. Using the Decorator pattern it is possible to change the behavior of the class during
 * runtime.
 * Decorator模式是子类化的一种更灵活的替代方法。Decorator类实现与目标相同的接口，并使用组合来“装饰”对目标的调用。使用Decorator模式，可以在运行时更改类的行为。
 *
 * <p>In this example we show how the simple {@link SimpleTroll} first attacks and then flees the
 * battle. Then we decorate the {@link SimpleTroll} with a {@link ClubbedTroll} and perform the
 * attack again. You can see how the behavior changes after the decoration.
 * 在这个例子中，我们展示了简单的{@link SimpleTroll}如何首先攻击，然后逃离战斗。然后我们用{@link ClubbedTroll}装饰{@link SimpleTroll}，并再次执行攻击。你可以看到装饰后行为的变化。
