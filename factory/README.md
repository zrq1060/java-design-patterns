## Intent

The Factory design pattern is intended to define an interface for creating an object, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created. This pattern is particularly useful when the creation process involves complexity.

提供一个封装在名为factory的类中的静态方法，以隐藏实现逻辑，并使客户端代码关注于使用，而不是初始化新对象。

## Explanation

Real-world example


> Imagine a scenario in a bakery where different types of cakes are made. The bakery has a "CakeFactory" where customers can order cakes. The CakeFactory can produce various types of cakes such as chocolate cake, vanilla cake, and strawberry cake. Instead of the bakery staff manually selecting ingredients and following specific recipes for each type of cake, they use the CakeFactory to handle the process. The customer simply requests a cake type, and the CakeFactory determines the appropriate ingredients and recipe to use, then creates the specific type of cake. This setup allows the bakery to easily add new cake types without modifying the core cake-making process, promoting flexibility and scalability.

Wikipedia says

> Factory is an object for creating other objects – formally a factory is a function or method that returns objects of a varying prototype or class.

**Programmatic Example**

Imagine an alchemist who is about to manufacture coins. The alchemist must be able to create both gold and copper coins and switching between them must be possible without modifying the existing source code. The factory pattern makes it possible by providing a static construction method which can be called with relevant parameters.

We have an interface `Coin` and two implementations `GoldCoin` and `CopperCoin`.

我们有一个接口`Coin`和两个实现`GoldCoin`和`CopperCoin`。

```java
public interface Coin {
  String getDescription();
}
```

```java
public class GoldCoin implements Coin {

  static final String DESCRIPTION = "This is a gold coin.";

  @Override
  public String getDescription() {
    return DESCRIPTION;
  }
}
```

```java
public class CopperCoin implements Coin {
   
  static final String DESCRIPTION = "This is a copper coin.";

  @Override
  public String getDescription() {
    return DESCRIPTION;
  }
}
```

Enumeration below represents types of coins that we support (`GoldCoin` and `CopperCoin`).

上面的枚举表示我们支持的硬币类型(“GoldCoin”和“CopperCoin”)。

```java
@RequiredArgsConstructor
@Getter
public enum CoinType {

  COPPER(CopperCoin::new),
  GOLD(GoldCoin::new);

  private final Supplier<Coin> constructor;
}
```

Then we have the static method `getCoin` to create coin objects encapsulated in the factory class `CoinFactory`.

然后我们有静态方法`getCoin`来创建封装在工厂类`CoinFactory`中的硬币对象。

```java
public class CoinFactory {

  public static Coin getCoin(CoinType type) {
    return type.getConstructor().get();
  }
}
```

Now, in the client code, we can generate various types of coins using the factory class.

现在，在客户端代码中，我们可以使用工厂类创建不同类型的硬币。

```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
    LOGGER.info("The alchemist begins his work.");
    var coin1 = CoinFactory.getCoin(CoinType.COPPER);
    var coin2 = CoinFactory.getCoin(CoinType.GOLD);
    LOGGER.info(coin1.getDescription());
    LOGGER.info(coin2.getDescription());
}
```

Program output:

```
06:19:53.530 [main] INFO com.iluwatar.factory.App -- The alchemist begins his work.
06:19:53.533 [main] INFO com.iluwatar.factory.App -- This is a copper coin.
06:19:53.533 [main] INFO com.iluwatar.factory.App -- This is a gold coin.
```

## Applicability
适用性

* Use the Factory pattern in Java when the class doesn't know beforehand the exact types and dependencies of the objects it needs to create.
* When a method returns one of several possible classes that share a common super class and wants to encapsulate the logic of which object to create.
* The pattern is commonly used when designing frameworks or libraries to give the best flexibility and isolation from concrete class types.

## Consequences

Benefits:

* Reduces coupling between the implementation of an application and the classes it uses.
* Supports the [Open/Closed Principle](https://java-design-patterns.com/principles/#open-closed-principle), as the system can introduce new types without changing existing code.

Trade-offs:

* The code can become more complicated due to the introduction of multiple additional classes.
* Overuse can make the code less readable if the underlying complexity of the object creation is low or unnecessary.

## Related Patterns

* [Abstract Factory](https://java-design-patterns.com/patterns/abstract-factory/): Can be considered a kind of Factory that works with groups of products.
* [Singleton](https://java-design-patterns.com/patterns/singleton/): Often used in conjunction with Factory to ensure that a class has only one instance.
* [Builder](https://java-design-patterns.com/patterns/builder/): Separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, similar to how factories manage instantiation.
* [Factory Kit](https://java-design-patterns.com/patterns/factory-kit/): Is a factory of immutable content with separated builder and factory interfaces.
