## Intent

Without violating encapsulation, capture and externalize an object's internal state so that the object can be restored to this state later.

在不违反封装的情况下，捕获并外部化对象的内部状态，以便稍后可以将对象恢复到此状态。

## Explanation

Real-world example

> Imagine a text editor application that allows users to write and edit documents. The text editor uses the Memento design pattern to implement its undo and redo functionality. Each time a user makes a change to the document, the editor creates a snapshot (memento) of the current state of the document. These snapshots are stored in a history list. When the user clicks the undo button, the editor restores the document to the state saved in the most recent memento. This process allows users to revert to previous versions of their document without exposing or altering the internal data structures of the editor.

In plain words

> Memento pattern captures object internal state making it easy to store and restore objects in any point of time.

Wikipedia says

> The memento pattern is a software design pattern that provides the ability to restore an object to its previous state (undo via rollback).

**Programmatic Example**

We are working on an astrology application where we need to analyze star properties over time. We are creating snapshots of star states using the Memento pattern.

Let's first define the types of stars we are capable to handle.

让我们首先定义我们能够处理的恒星类型。

```java
public enum StarType {
  SUN("sun"),
  RED_GIANT("red giant"),
  WHITE_DWARF("white dwarf"),
  SUPERNOVA("supernova"),
  DEAD("dead star");
  // ...
}
```

Next, let's jump straight to the essentials. Here's the `Star` class along with the mementos that we need to manipulate. Especially pay attention to `getMemento` and `setMemento` methods.

接下来，让我们直入主题。这是Star类以及我们需要操作的备忘录。特别要注意getMemento和setMemento方法。

```java
public interface StarMemento {
}

public class Star {

    private StarType type;
    private int ageYears;
    private int massTons;

    public Star(StarType startType, int startAge, int startMass) {
        this.type = startType;
        this.ageYears = startAge;
        this.massTons = startMass;
    }

    public void timePasses() {
        ageYears *= 2;
        massTons *= 8;
        switch (type) {
            case RED_GIANT -> type = StarType.WHITE_DWARF;
            case SUN -> type = StarType.RED_GIANT;
            case SUPERNOVA -> type = StarType.DEAD;
            case WHITE_DWARF -> type = StarType.SUPERNOVA;
            case DEAD -> {
                ageYears *= 2;
                massTons = 0;
            }
            default -> {
            }
        }
    }

    StarMemento getMemento() {
        var state = new StarMementoInternal();
        state.setAgeYears(ageYears);
        state.setMassTons(massTons);
        state.setType(type);
        return state;
    }

    void setMemento(StarMemento memento) {
        var state = (StarMementoInternal) memento;
        this.type = state.getType();
        this.ageYears = state.getAgeYears();
        this.massTons = state.getMassTons();
    }

    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return String.format("%s age: %d years mass: %d tons", type.toString(), ageYears, massTons);
    }

    private static class StarMementoInternal implements StarMemento {

        private StarType type;
        private int ageYears;
        private int massTons;

        // setters and getters ->
        // ...
    }
}
```

And finally here's how we use the mementos to store and restore star states.

最后是我们如何使用这些备忘录来存储和恢复星州。

```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
    var states = new Stack<StarMemento>();

    var star = new Star(StarType.SUN, 10000000, 500000);
    LOGGER.info(star.toString());
    states.add(star.getMemento());
    star.timePasses();
    LOGGER.info(star.toString());
    states.add(star.getMemento());
    star.timePasses();
    LOGGER.info(star.toString());
    states.add(star.getMemento());
    star.timePasses();
    LOGGER.info(star.toString());
    states.add(star.getMemento());
    star.timePasses();
    LOGGER.info(star.toString());
    while (!states.isEmpty()) {
        star.setMemento(states.pop());
        LOGGER.info(star.toString());
    }
}
```

Program output:

```
14:09:15.878 [main] INFO com.iluwatar.memento.App -- sun age: 10000000 years mass: 500000 tons
14:09:15.880 [main] INFO com.iluwatar.memento.App -- red giant age: 20000000 years mass: 4000000 tons

```

## Applicability
适用性

Use the Memento pattern when

以下情况使用备忘录模式

* A snapshot of an object's state must be saved so that it can be restored to that state later, and
* A direct interface to obtaining the state would expose implementation details and break the object's encapsulation

## Known uses
已知使用

* Java Util Package: Various classes in the Java Util Package, such as java.util.Date and java.util.Calendar, can be reverted to previous states using similar principles, though not implemented directly as the Memento Pattern.
* Undo mechanisms in software: Text editors and graphic editors often use this pattern to implement undo actions.

## Consequences

Benefits:

* Preserves encapsulation boundaries.
* Simplifies the originator by removing the need to manage version history or undo functionality directly.

Trade-offs:

* Can be expensive in terms of memory if a large number of states are saved.
* Care must be taken to manage the lifecycle of mementos to avoid memory leaks.

## Related Patterns

* [Command](https://java-design-patterns.com/patterns/command/): Often used together; commands store state for undoing operations in mementos.
* [Prototype](https://java-design-patterns.com/patterns/prototype/): Mementos may use prototyping to store the state.
