/**
 * A proxy, in its most general form, is a class functioning as an interface to something else. The
 * proxy could interface to anything: a network connection, a large object in memory, a file, or
 * some other resource that is expensive or impossible to duplicate. In short, a proxy is a wrapper
 * or agent object that is being called by the client to access the real serving object behind the
 * scenes.
 * 代理，在其最一般的形式中，是作为其他东西接口的类。代理可以连接到任何东西:网络连接、内存中的大对象、文件或其他一些昂贵或无法复制的资源。
 * 简而言之，代理是客户机调用的包装器或代理对象，用于在幕后访问实际的服务对象。
 *
 * <p>The Proxy design pattern allows you to provide an interface to other objects by creating a
 * wrapper class as the proxy. The wrapper class, which is the proxy, can add additional
 * functionality to the object of interest without changing the object's code.
 * 通过创建包装器类作为代理，代理设计模式允许您为其他对象提供接口。包装器类(即代理)可以向感兴趣的对象添加额外的功能，而无需更改对象的代码。
 *
 * <p>In this example the proxy ({@link WizardTowerProxy}) controls access to the actual object (
 * {@link IvoryTower}).
 * 在这个例子中，代理({@link WizardTowerProxy})控制对实际对象({@link IvoryTower})的访问。
